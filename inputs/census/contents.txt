- page: https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2010/geo/county-adjacency.html
- link: https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/county_adjacency.txt
- description: given a FIPs in cols 0 and 1, in cols 2 and 3 list all adjacent FIPS
- columns:
    0: county name, county state
    1: county FIPS
    2: county name, county state that is adjacent to county in columns 0 and 1
    3: FIPS for county in col 2
- notes: this file is ancient and has many problems which need to be manually fixed. At time of writing, no more current version exists (I asked), but later in 2023 it should be made available.


county_adjacency/adjacency_edges_to_be_deleted.csv

- description: list of edges between Nodes (directionless) which are suggested to be removed from epidemiological adjacency maps. 
- link: https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/metroarea/us_wall/Mar2020/CBSA_WallMap_Mar2020.pdf
- This file was created by Lauren Wszolek by visually inspecting maps of the FIPS and CBSA designations of the counties, and making a note when FIPS a "neighbor" is actually across a body of water with no land borders. This happens because the FIPS maps are sometimes drawn to extend into bodies of water, such as Lake Michigan. See the link for a map showing the CBSA/FIPS borders which shows how problematic the Great Lakes are.
This list is not exhaustive, since there are many water borders along the coasts, but I have made note of the most egregious examples where the offending counties are not within a short drive of one another, and are often separated by many miles across water. Please see the larger report for additional details.
- columns:
	0: FIPS code of first
	1: FIPS code of second
- note: I did *not* actually remove these edges from the edge lists - they are merely a suggestion for the future.

- description: I needed a way to map the cities of airports to a FIPS, and this was the only document anywhere that was willing to map a city to a county. Since I am using CBSAs, whichever county the airport gets placed nearly always ends up in the wider CBSA.
- columns:
    0: State FIPS
    1: State abbr
    3: Place name (CDP)
    4: County FIPS
    5: CBSA code
    6: CBSA title
- notes: this file is from 2006, and there have been many changes since then to FIPS and CBSAs. A lot of manual work was required in the processing file to try and accommodate the changes. Also, this file came with its own documentation. See place_cbsa/place-cbsa-doc.txt

- library required:
- page: as far as I could tell, this report was not accessible via the UI. I discovered it through URL spelunking out of desperation.
- link to file layout doc: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2020-2021/CO-EST2021-ALLDATA.pdf
- link to file: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2020-2021/counties/totals/co-est2021-alldata.csv
- description: census 2020 by state by FIPS
- note: I did not find a 2020 census population file linking populations with FIPS until very late, and instead needed to rely on manual work and hacks to accommodate Hamilton's method in /process_inputs/jhu.py. This file is included because it is difficult to locate and it may be useful if deciding to integrate additional deaths aside from those reported, or other adjustments, in the future.

county_fips/national_county.txt

- type: txt file
- accessed: 8/23/2022
- page: none, cannot access through UI that I could find
- link: https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt
- description: for each state, lists each county by name and FIPS
- columns:
    0: state abbr
    1: first 2 digits of FIPS (state code)
    2: last 3 digits of FIPS (county code)
    3: county name
    4: county type code
- addl notes: has an updated timestamp of 2014, but it is unknown precisely what year this represents as this file is not accessible through the interface, only URL manipulation. However, this is the only version of the file which appears to be currently accessible on the census website (UPDATE: located another more recent version, replacing this file)

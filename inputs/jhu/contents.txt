While I have included most reports, this report is a sparse checkout from github because the file is updated daily with frequent backfills. More information can be found in the report. You may also obtain the report at the Github link below.

`git clone --no-checkout git@github.com:CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git`
`cd COVID-19`
`git sparse-checkout init --cone`
`git checkout @`
`git sparse-checkout set csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/`

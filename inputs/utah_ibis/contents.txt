health_districts_fips.txt
- I made this file myself from the information posted at https://ibis.health.utah.gov/ibisph-view/about/LocalHealth.html, combined with the FIPS mappings from census/county_fips/all-geocodes-v2020.xlsx. I was not able to find this data in a downloadable form or table.
- columns:
    0: name of health district
    1: fips of county contained in health district
    2: name of county

- notes: this report can also generate population by county, but this data is not using actual census data yet, and is an estimate per text on the page: "The data in this module were updated in September 2019 based on the U.S.Census Vintage 2018 intercensal estimates." For this reason, I have chosen to stick with the official census population numbers
